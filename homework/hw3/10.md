# Problem 10
Problem: Perform an online search using the term Kronecker product. Find sites that describe the product and applications of the Kronecker product. Write up a paragraph or two describing this topic citing at least three web pages and/or web sites.

Answer: The Kronecker Product is when you take the first matrix and each entry will be a scalar to the second matrix.  This will create a large matrix with the scalar multiples of the second, creating "blocks" of matrices in the new matrix.  This product can help optimize matrix problems. For some applications, "These include signal processing, image processing, semidefinite programming, and quantum computing" (2000).
