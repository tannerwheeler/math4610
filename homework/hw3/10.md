# Problem 10
The Kronecker Product is when you take the first matrix and each entry will be a scalar to the second matrix.  This will create a large matrix with the scalar multiples of the second, creating "blocks" of matrices in the new matrix.  This product can help optimize matrix problems. For some applications, "These include signal processing, image processing, semidefinite programming, and quantum computing" (2000).
