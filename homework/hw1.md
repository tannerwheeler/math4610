## Homework #1
#### Tanner Wheeler

### 1. Problem: Write a code that will return machine precision for your computer (or any other computer for that matter) in single precision arithmetic. Give the method a name that is descriptive. For example, maceps(), or something like that. The routine should return the default machine precision. Create a second routine that will return the machine precision in double precision computations. Give the routine a unique name, say dmaceps(). Make sure that your code is fully documented with you as the author and so on. An example of a Fortran code is included in this repository. You can translate this into a Python, C, or C++ code to do the work. You can also modify the Fortran and use this directly.

#### Answer:



### 2. Problem: Create a repository on [Github](https://www.github.com) and create a repositry for this homework that will contain a software manual for all the code you will write and work with in the course.

#### Answer:



### 3. Problem: Create a shared library from the routines you have created.

#### Answer:



### 4. Problem: In this problem you will learn a bit more about your computer and how many processes you can run on the cores included in your computer.

#### Answer:



### 5. Problem: We will use Taylor series expansions in a lot of the work we do in Math 4610. Expand the following functions about the given center x_o.  Find the radius of convergence of each of the series.

#### Answer:



### 6. Problem: Compute the following antiderivatives.

#### Answer:



### 7. Problem: Write a routine that will return the roots of a quadratic polynomial in an array. Also, create a software manual entry for the routine and include this in your software manual.

#### Answer:



### 8. Problem: Compute the solutions for the following simple initial value problems.

#### Answer:



### 9. Problem: Search the internet for an application that is influenced by machine precision. Write a paragraph on one of the results you have found. Identify one and only one such web site. Make sure that you cite the web site appropriately.
